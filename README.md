## Overview

In a future not too distant, the boundaries of human exploration have extended far beyond our home planet. Space exploration and colonization have become remarkable feats of human achievement, with space stations serving as the key outposts for these endeavors. Regular check-ups, system upgrades, and troubleshooting have become paramount to maintaining the delicate balance between human survival and scientific progress. ðŸš€

Recognizing the need for efficient and reliable solutions, this theme revolves around a scenario where a robot is dispatched to a space station, divided into different modules, to rectify any problems that arise. Prompted by wireless alerts from the central hub, the robot navigates through the modules, swiftly locating faulty or missing components. It then communicates the issue to the central hub before heading to the electronics warehouse to perform the necessary repairs.

The core challenge of this theme lies in constructing the AstroTinker Bot using Verilog HDL (Hardware Description Language), unveiling the remarkable parallel processing capabilities offered by FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays). Through Verilog coding, the robot adeptly perceives its environment and performs essential tasks by communicating wirelessly with the central hub.
